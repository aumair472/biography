            <h2>Atomic Father of Pakistan</h2>
            <p><b>Abdul Qadeer Khan (1 April 1936 – 10 October 2021),[3] known as A. Q. Khan</b>, was a Pakistani
                nuclear
                physicist and
                metallurgical engineer who is colloquially known as the "father of Pakistan's atomic weapons
                program".[a]

                An émigré (Muhajir) from India who migrated to Pakistan in 1952, Khan was educated in the metallurgical
                engineering departments of Western European technical universities where he pioneered studies in phase
                transitions of metallic alloys, uranium metallurgy, and isotope separation based on gas centrifuges.
                After learning of India's "Smiling Buddha" nuclear test in 1974, Khan joined his nation's clandestine
                efforts to develop atomic weapons when he founded the Khan Research Laboratories (KRL) in 1976 and was
                both its chief scientist and director for many years.

                In January 2004, Khan was subjected to a debriefing by the Musharraf administration over evidence of
                nuclear proliferation handed to them by the Bush administration of the United States.[6][7] Khan
                admitted his role in running a nuclear proliferation network – only to retract his statements in later
                years when he leveled accusations at the former administration of Pakistan's Prime Minister Benazir
                Bhutto in 1990, and also directed allegations at President Musharraf over the controversy in
                2008.[8][9][10]

                Khan was accused of selling nuclear secrets illegally and was put under house arrest in 2004. After
                years of house arrest, Khan successfully filed a lawsuit against the Federal Government of Pakistan at
                the Islamabad High Court whose verdict declared his debriefing unconstitutional and freed him on 6
                February 2009.[11][12] The United States reacted negatively to the verdict and the Obama administration
                issued an official statement warning that Khan still remained a "serious proliferation risk".[13]

                After his death on 10 October 2021, he was given a state funeral at Faisal Mosque before being buried at
                the H-8 graveyard in Islamabad.</p>
